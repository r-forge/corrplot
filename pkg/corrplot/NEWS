		CHANGES IN corrplot VERSION 0.60
		
NEW FEATURES
  *  Now corrplot() can deal with the matrix not in [-1,1] by parameter "zoom" now.
     Warning: please make sure the visualization you take after data zoom is meaningful!
  
CHANGES
  *  Function corr.rect() was renamed as corrRect().
  *  Revise document. (THANKS, Tao Gao)
  *  In function corrplot(), "order"'s choice "PCA" was precisely renamed as "AOE".
	 and "FPC" was added for the first principal component order.
  *  Add function corrMatOrder(), and corrplot.mixed().
  *  Remove seldom used functions: corrplot.circle(), corrplot.ellipse(), 
     corrplot.square(), corrplot.shade(), corrplot.color(), corrplot.number().
  *  In corrplot(), remove parameter "assign.col" and "cl.range",
     add "zoom", "cl.lim" and "addCoefasPercent".

  *  Parameter "tl.cex" in function corrplot() is more sensitive.
  
BUG FIXES

     or a larger font size) has been fixed.
  *  Specifying wrong color to the glyphs has been fixed.
