# An Introduction to corrplot

The  **corrplot** package is a graphical display of a correlation matrix, confidence interval. 
It also contains some algorithms to do matrix reordering.  In addition, corrplot is good at details,
including choosing color, text labels, color labels, layout, etc.


```{r show-off, dev="CairoPNG"}
data(mtcars)
M <- cor(mtcars)
##  different color series
col1 <- colorRampPalette(c("#7F0000","red","#FF7F00","yellow","white", 
			"cyan", "#007FFF", "blue","#00007F"))
col2 <- colorRampPalette(c("#67001F", "#B2182B", "#D6604D", "#F4A582", "#FDDBC7",
			"#FFFFFF", "#D1E5F0", "#92C5DE", "#4393C3", "#2166AC", "#053061"))	
col3 <- colorRampPalette(c("red", "white", "blue"))	
col4 <- colorRampPalette(c("#7F0000","red","#FF7F00","yellow","#7FFF7F", 
			"cyan", "#007FFF", "blue","#00007F"))	
wb <- c("white","black")
library(corrplot)
corrplot(M)
